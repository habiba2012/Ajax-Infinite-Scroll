#[Project: Infinite Scroll and Submitting a Form with AJAX](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/infinite-scroll-and-submitting-a-form-with-ajax)

Web app created using jQuery to make ajax requests to the Open Movie Database API.  The user can search for specific or random movies.   The “Find Random Movies” button displays movies in increments of ten and loads another ten when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page.  Clicking on a movie displays more information about the movie.
